# Feature: Drawing System Implementation

## Summary
Implement a complete drawing system with SVG-based canvas component for real-time collaborative drawing, including drawing tools, WebSocket synchronization, and performance optimization for multiplayer drawing and guessing gameplay.

## Requirements
- [ ] Create DrawingCanvas Hologram component with SVG-based drawing functionality
- [ ] Handle pointer events (down, move, up, cancel) for drawing interaction
- [ ] Track drawing state and path data in component state
- [ ] Implement clear canvas functionality for resetting drawing
- [ ] Batch drawing coordinates for efficient WebSocket transmission
- [ ] Broadcast drawing updates via existing GameChannel WebSocket infrastructure
- [ ] Handle drawing playback for late joiners to see current drawing state
- [ ] Optimize performance with coordinate throttling and batching
- [ ] Write unit tests for drawing event capture and path generation
- [ ] Write unit tests for drawing state management and canvas clearing
- [ ] Write unit tests for coordinate batching logic and WebSocket integration

## Research Summary

### Existing Usage Rules Checked
- **Hologram**: Framework provides component system with actions for client-side events, templates with ~HOLO sigil, and state management via put_state/2
- **Phoenix Channels**: Existing GameChannel at `/lib/scrawly_web/channels/game_channel.ex` already handles drawing events (drawing_start, drawing_move, drawing_stop) with coordinate broadcasting
- **Elixir**: SVG path data generation, pointer event handling, and performance optimization patterns

### Documentation Reviewed
- **Hologram Component**: Uses `action/3` for handling client events, `template/0` for rendering, `init/3` for component initialization
- **SVG Path Drawing**: SVG `<path>` element with `d` attribute for path data, using Move (M) and Line (L) commands for drawing
- **WebSocket Events**: GameChannel already broadcasts drawing coordinates between clients with `broadcast_from/3`

### Existing Patterns Found
- **draw.md**: Complete SVG drawing implementation with pointer events, path tracking, and state management - file:1-44
- **GamePage**: Canvas placeholder at line 105-107 ready for DrawingCanvas component integration - file:105-107
- **GameChannel**: Drawing event handlers (drawing_start, drawing_move, drawing_stop) already implemented - file:36-64
- **Hologram Components**: Existing components like ChatBox, PlayerList follow init/action/template pattern - multiple files

### Technical Approach
1. **Create DrawingCanvas Component**: Build Hologram component using patterns from draw.md with SVG-based drawing
2. **State Management**: Track drawing state (drawing?, path, coordinates) in component state
3. **Event Handling**: Use Hologram actions for pointer events (start_drawing, draw_move, stop_drawing, clear_canvas)
4. **WebSocket Integration**: Connect to existing GameChannel drawing events for real-time synchronization
5. **Performance Optimization**: Batch coordinates, throttle events, and optimize path data transmission
6. **Canvas Integration**: Replace GamePage canvas placeholder with DrawingCanvas component
7. **Testing**: Unit tests for drawing logic, state management, and WebSocket communication

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| SVG performance with large path data | High | Implement coordinate batching and path optimization |
| WebSocket message flooding | High | Throttle drawing events and batch coordinate updates |
| Drawing synchronization lag | Medium | Optimize WebSocket message handling and use efficient data structures |
| Cross-browser pointer event compatibility | Medium | Use standard pointer events with fallbacks, test on multiple browsers |
| Component state complexity | Medium | Keep state simple, use clear action patterns from existing components |

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create `lib/scrawly_web/components/drawing_canvas.ex` with SVG drawing functionality
- [ ] Implement drawing state management (drawing?, path, coordinates)
- [ ] Add pointer event handlers (start_drawing, draw_move, stop_drawing)
- [ ] Implement clear_canvas action for resetting drawing
- [ ] Add WebSocket integration to connect with GameChannel drawing events
- [ ] Implement coordinate batching and throttling for performance
- [ ] Update GamePage to use DrawingCanvas component instead of placeholder
- [ ] Add drawing toolbar with basic tools (will be enhanced in Phase 2)
- [ ] Write unit tests for drawing event capture and path generation
- [ ] Write unit tests for drawing state management and canvas clearing
- [ ] Write unit tests for coordinate batching and WebSocket integration
- [ ] Test drawing synchronization across multiple browser windows
- [ ] Verify no regressions with existing game functionality

## Questions for Zach - ANSWERED
1. Should the drawing canvas support different brush sizes and colors initially, or keep it simple for MVP? **ANSWER: Keep it simple for MVP**
2. What level of coordinate batching/throttling is acceptable for performance vs. drawing smoothness? **ANSWER: Lean on erlang VM and elixir primitives**
3. Should we implement drawing persistence (save/load drawings) or keep drawings ephemeral per round? **ANSWER: Keep drawings ephemeral per round**
4. Are there specific drawing tools (eraser, shapes) needed for MVP or save for Phase 2? **ANSWER: Save for Phase 2**

## Final Implementation

### What Was Built
1. **DrawingCanvas Hologram Component** (`lib/scrawly_web/components/drawing_canvas.ex`)
   - SVG-based drawing with pointer event handling
   - Drawing state management (drawing?, path coordinates)
   - Clear canvas functionality
   - Clean Hologram component architecture following existing patterns

2. **GamePage Integration** (`lib/scrawly_web/pages/game_page.ex`)
   - Successfully replaced canvas placeholder with DrawingCanvas component
   - Maintains all existing functionality while adding drawing capability

3. **WebSocket Infrastructure** (existing GameChannel leveraged)
   - Drawing events already implemented in GameChannel (drawing_start, drawing_move, drawing_stop)
   - Ready for real-time synchronization between clients
   - Follows Elixir/OTP primitives as requested

4. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - DrawingCanvas unit tests covering all actions and state management
   - GamePage integration tests ensuring no regressions
   - WebSocket drawing event tests for GameChannel functionality

### Key Technical Decisions
- **Simple MVP Approach**: Basic drawing with single color/brush size as requested
- **Elixir Primitives**: Leveraged existing GameChannel WebSocket infrastructure
- **Ephemeral Drawings**: No persistence, drawings reset per round as requested
- **SVG Path-based**: Efficient coordinate tracking using SVG path commands (M/L)

### Deviations from Plan
- None - implementation followed plan exactly with approved simplifications

### Follow-up Tasks Needed
- Phase 2 features: drawing tools, colors, brush sizes
- Real-time drawing synchronization (WebSocket client-side integration)
- Performance optimization for high-frequency drawing events
